    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Data/Analytics Engineer who completed a Maths degree (Statistics and Applied Maths). I have worked as a Data Lead at the following companies/industries:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Myriota Pty Ltd: Space Telecommunications (Private Sector)</li>
            <li>SA Health (NALHN): Health Care (Public Sector)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            My core soft skills/personal philosophies include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attention to detail - I likely annoy people with how many errors/typos I pick up</li>
            <li>Desire for logic/optimisation/efficiency - If I can improve a process, I will. If a process doesn't make sense to me, I will (respectfully) question it</li>
            <li>Organisation - Yes I probably have a spreadsheet for "that" (however, I believe spreadsheets should be project management tool only. They should not be used for non-adhoc data analysis/graphs!)</li>
            <li>Desire to work for a company that is alturistic and benefits the world</li>
            <li>Think in data</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="philosophy">
        <h2>Data Philosophy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One source of truth - ("some_document_v3_final_actual_final_version(3)" makes me cry inside)</li>
            <li>Work smarter, not harder (recall optimisation/efficiency)</li>
            <li>Automate as much as possible</li>
            <li>Incremental Improvement</li>
            <li>Openness/Sharing: sharing is caring, no reinventing the wheel (work smarter, not harder)</li>
            <li>Collaboration: more brains = more ideas/view points = better solutions/outcomes</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
